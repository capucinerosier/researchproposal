    <h1>Research Propsal </hl>
    <h1>Introduction</h1>
  <p>The proposed research proposal is : Why do people choose to live in small towns? This research topic surrounds the concepts of urbanization, political science, humanities, and locational mindsets. Although this question can seem vague and uninteresting at first glance, the underlying reasons on why people choose to live where they live can help understand the disparities and polarization that this country has been seeing in the last few years. Societies form from people coming together, and communities forming their own customs, cultures, and concepts fundamentally control how the economy, government, and politics work together. This research question can also touch on controversial topics such as women's rights, LBGTQ rights, immigration, healthcare, and global warming. It is important to know how rural communities feel about global issues that seem more adherent in urbanized environments.</p>
