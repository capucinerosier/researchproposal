    <h1>Research Propsal </hl>
    <h1>Introduction</h1>
  <p>The proposed research proposal is : Why do people choose to live in small towns? This research topic surrounds the concepts of urbanization, political science, humanities, and locational mindsets. Although this question can seem vague and uninteresting at first glance, the underlying reasons on why people choose to live where they live can help understand the disparities and polarization that this country has been seeing in the last few years. Societies form from people coming together, and communities forming their own customs, cultures, and concepts fundamentally control how the economy, government, and politics work together. This research question can also touch on controversial topics such as women's rights, LBGTQ rights, immigration, healthcare, and global warming. It is important to know how rural communities feel about global issues that seem more adherent in urbanized environments.</p>

  <h3> Background/Review of Literature </h3>
  <p>The study of small town living has been plenty researched in the last decade. There are a plethora of questions encircling rural living, but most of them are focusing on one specific subsection to the research question. The article “‘THAT'S THE PROBLEM WITH LIVING IN A SMALL TOWN’: PRIVACY AND SEXUAL HEALTH ISSUES FOR YOUNG RURAL PEOPLE” written by Deborah Warr and Lynne Hillier explore the topic on the lack of privacy that is seen in rural communities; specifically around sexual health issues. In the abstract, they state that “ girls [express] more awareness of and concern towards their public reputations when accessing sexual health services.” (Warr & Hillier, 2008). 
	Furthermore, articles have been published on the benefits of living in less populated areas. Marie Croce of The Neighborhood emphasizes that living in a small town comes with a lower cost of living, and a higher opportunity at taking advantage of capitalism. According to Business Insider, ``The average revenue per business in America's biggest cities is $1.4 million, but the number is tripled to $4 million in smaller cities and towns.” (Croce, 2020). The two being put together can equal a higher quality of life for individuals who decide to reside in tighter-knit communities. 
	Much of the research surrounding the focus question lacks one key idea that is crucial to this proposed research question. Is there a trend seen that accounts for the polerizations seen across the nation in the last decade? Does the location of one determine how they will think, act, and participate in global complexities? I am inquired as to why people decide to live in small towns, what traditions they hold at heart, but also if that equates in the formula of the contrasted mindsets seen across an urban and rural gradient.

<div id="Rationale" class="tabcontent">
  <h3>Rationale</h3>
  <p>The specific questions I am exploring are: why do people choose to live in small towns and how do geographic segmentations influence the way that people think. These questions raise awareness on issues that have separated so many communities apart. The hypothesis that geographics do play a role on how people think will be evaluated with the questions that are proposed. The goal of this research is to see how concepts and ideas are created, and how everything surrounding their geographical presence controls their values and morals. It will allow others to understand how society and the government work when the question is answered. This would also allow for room to discuss possible solutions to the glorified separation in this country. If the hypothesis is disconfirmed, then it proves that more studies on sociology and the psychology of individuals needs to be conducted. This would allow for more research on societies, evolution, and psychology.

<div id="Method & Design" class="tabcontent">
  <h3>Method & Design</h3>
  <p>I believe that the best method used for this type of research question would be participant observation, and interviews. My plan would be to travel to small towns in Oregon (Mitchel, Baker City) and spend about two weeks per down collecting data. The data here would be in the form of qualitative study, and narrative study. I would find random people in the town and ask for their consent to interview them. The only target market are residents of the towns I am visiting. I am not looking for any particular race,gender,age group. I am solely looking for residents of the  area. This sample allows me to expand the data. Not everybody has the same story, and reaching numerous  individuals would show the juxtaposition of data. Then, I would record their answers to the questions I am asking. I would have a list of questions I would ask each participant, but also go with the flow of the conversation I am having. If they start talking about something I haven’t heard before, I would ask them to expand their thoughts and to continue to discuss whatever they are talking about. I believe that having open ended communication in addition to closed, structured interviews would reach the highest percentage of data.
	My hypothesis could be confirmed or unconfirmed from the data because their answers would impact the precision of what I originally predicted. The data being collected is to understand the research question and to see if my hypothesis was correct or not. Although this data can help understand my research question, it is also important to note that I would only be conducting data on a miniscule group of people. They (the participants) cannot fully represent every individual that relates to the study, but can help the researchers with opening their knowledge.
	In addition, I would like to do participant observation where I take a look at their unedited, authentic day-to-day lives without any interruption. I’d like to observe from a far and see how the community is run. I would pull from these observations and make my own analysis. This form of participation would allow me to get an insight on the tight-knit community I am observing. I would participate in this observation by sitting in local coffee shops, parks, and schools. The manipulated data would be the locations inside the small town, and where I decide to place myself in the participant observation. Manipulating the data always risks the form of data one is collecting. The data can change depending on the activity level of these locations. If I place myself in an area with few people or people who do not wish to participate in my study, then I am left with less data. The hypothesis would be questioned due to the lack of data. My hypothesis can be disconfirmed from the data by analysing what the answers of the individuals say about living in a small town. I am open to having my hypothesis rejected and believe that it is a crucial part of data collection. 
	The controlled variables are: the location of my study (the town), and the questions I am asking in the interview series. This consistency helps accurately collect data and safely follows the protocols for confirming my hypothesis.
